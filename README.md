## Description

Recognizing the limitations of accessing international news due to regional social media restrictions, I conceptualized Newcifer to address this gap in my daily information consumption. By crafting an app that prioritizes user preferences and customization, I aimed to create a tool that not only meets my own needs but also resonates with a wider audience of news enthusiasts. Being an avid reader and consumer of news, Newcifer serves as a daily companion, allowing me to stay informed about global events while residing in Canada, where access to international news is restricted.

This app was first created using classes in JavaScript; then refactored to function based. You can find repositories for both in my profile.

### `npm start`

This app can only run on your local server as News API only allows development on the local server in a free plan.
